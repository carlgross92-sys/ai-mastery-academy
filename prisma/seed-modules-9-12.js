Time savings (how many hours/week would this save?)\n2. Quality improvement (how much better would output be?)\n3. Implementation ease (how hard is this to set up?)\n4. Risk level (what happens if AI makes a mistake?)\n5. Scale potential (can this expand across the org?)\n\nPrioritize: High time savings + Easy implementation + Low risk\nThese are your quick wins.\n\nExample high-impact use cases:\n• Email drafting and summarization (saves 5-10 hrs/week)\n• Report generation from data (saves 3-5 hrs/week)\n• Customer support response drafts (saves 10+ hrs/week)\n• Meeting notes and action items (saves 2-3 hrs/week)\n• Content creation and editing (saves 5-15 hrs/week)</pre><h2>Measuring AI ROI</h2><pre style="background: rgba(0,0,0,0.3); padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px;">ROI Formula:\n\nAI ROI = (Value Created - Cost of AI) / Cost of AI × 100\n\nValue Created:\n• Time saved × average hourly cost of employees\n• Revenue increase from better decisions\n• Cost reduction from automation\n• Quality improvements (fewer errors, revisions)\n\nCost of AI:\n• Subscription/API costs\n• Training time (temporary productivity dip)\n• Implementation and integration costs\n\nExample:\n• 10 employees save 5 hours/week each = 50 hours/week\n• Average loaded cost: $60/hour\n• Weekly value: $3,000 → Monthly: $13,000 → Annual: $156,000\n• AI tool costs: $2,000/year\n• ROI: ($156,000 - $2,000) / $2,000 = 7,700% ROI</pre><h2>Key Takeaways</h2><ol><li><strong>4 phases:</strong> Explore → Implement → Scale → Transform</li><li><strong>Start with quick wins</strong> — high impact, low risk, easy to implement</li><li><strong>Measure ROI systematically</strong> — time savings × hourly cost</li><li><strong>Build internal champions</strong> who drive adoption across teams</li><li><strong>AI transformation is a journey</strong> — plan for 12-24 months</li></ol><h2>Coming Up Next</h2><p>Lesson 9.2 covers building AI-first teams — hiring, training, and creating a culture of AI innovation.</p></div>`,
